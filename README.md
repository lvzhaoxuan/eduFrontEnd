# eduFrontEnd
A basical front webpages for my school work 'eduProfile-A block chain system for electronic diploma'
basucally i dont use a lot technics,just a few vue sentences and some javascripts for page reaction.
for interface reaction, u should check the axios part where i wrote some easy javascripts codes to achieve that
we deploy the java code as the 'server' and using FISCO BCOS as block chain system, for manage ,we r using webase-front as nodes management. if you interested in that ,
u should check their github pages and their dev docs.
thats all i want to say
